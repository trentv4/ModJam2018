# Musical Energy [Modjam 2018]

This mod adds a set of mystical instruments into the world. These instruments can be found in the creative tab only currently. These instruments can be played with QWEASD to cast magical spells. Each note played correlates to an element, which adds an effect to your spell. Depending on your instrument, that spell could be aimed at the entity you're looking at, all of the entities around you, or yourself!
